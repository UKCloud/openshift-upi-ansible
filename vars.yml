# Net2 implements a second subnet for Net2 workers
#  - it requires v4.7+ and (unless the net2 network has Internet access) it needs disconnected install
#  - Currently, the whole cluster needs to use the same DNS servers (because dns daemonset in
#    openshift-dns is installed on all nodes and the svc round-robins between them
#  - externalDNSisOnNet2 defines whether the DNS servers are accessed via Net2 (by the whole cluster)

# These are implemented as neutron routes on the Net2 subnet
# Should include:
# - IP of disconnected installation registry (plus any ECS/S3 endpoint IP it uses)
# - API endpoint of OpenStack cloud
# (Routes for DNS servers do not need to be specified here; they are added automatically)
# (Routes for comms to primary ospSubnet are also added automatically)

# - unless the private registry allows anonymous pull then the pull-secret.txt file should include an auth
