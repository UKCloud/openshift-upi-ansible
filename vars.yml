#  - Net2 playbooks do not support Kuryr...
#  - Currently, the whole cluster needs to use the same DNS servers (because dns daemonset in
#    openshift-dns is installed on all nodes and the svc round-robins between them.
#  - The cluster needs to be able to resolve its own external name (for oauth etc) and its OpenStack cloud API
#    via the specified externalDNS.
#  - "externalDNSisOnNet2" defines whether the externalDNS servers are accessed via Net2 (when set to True)
#    or via the primary network (when set to False) - this applies to nodes on both networks!
