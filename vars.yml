# Net2 implements a second subnet for Net2 workers.
#  - it requires v4.7+ and (unless the net2 network has Internet access) it needs disconnected install.
#  - Net2 playbooks do not support Kuryr...
#  - Currently, the whole cluster needs to use the same DNS servers (because dns daemonset in
#    openshift-dns is installed on all nodes and the svc round-robins between them.
#  - The cluster needs to be able to resolve its own external name (for oauth etc) and its OpenStack cloud API
#    via the specified externalDNS.
#  - "externalDNSisOnNet2" defines whether the externalDNS servers are accessed via Net2 (when set to True)
#    or via the primary network (when set to False) - this applies to nodes on both networks!

# A list of destinations that will be routed back towards the Primary Cluster network router.
# These are implemented as neutron host routes on the Net2 subnet.
# Should include:
# - IP of disconnected installation registry (plus any ECS/S3 endpoint IP it uses)
# - IP of API endpoint of OpenStack cloud
# (Routes for DNS servers do not need to be specified here; they are added automatically)
# (Routes for comms to primary ospSubnet are also added automatically)

# - the entire imageContentSources: string should be indented by 2 spaces under the | as show in the example.
# - unless the private registry allows anonymous pull, the pull-secret.txt file should include an auth
